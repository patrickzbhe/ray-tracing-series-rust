# Ray Tracing Series in Rust

Implementation (+ additional experimentation) of Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series](https://raytracing.github.io/).

# Implementation

Starting out by just mostly translating the C++ codebase, then converting it into (somewhat) idiomatic Rust.
Also adding some random stuff plus performance optimizations, which I'll benchmark.
Using minimal dependencies.
